# Changelog

All notable changes to the Computer Evolution Comparison Tool will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - 2024-06-04

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes - Performance Summary Accuracy

#### Fixed
- **Performance Summary Logic**: Fixed widespread bug where comparison results were inverted
  - Previously: "Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Phone is less powerful" (when it was actually more powerful)
  - Now: "Snapdragon 855 Phone is less powerful" (correctly describing computer1 vs computer2)
- **Grammar Issues**: Fixed "is has" construction in comparison descriptions
  - Before: "Computer is has more storage"
  - After: "Computer has more storage"
- **Consistent Evaluation Logic**: Now properly evaluates "Is computer1 better than computer2?" 
  - Always describes computer1's relationship to computer2
  - Handles both higher-is-better (compute, memory, storage) and lower-is-better (power, weight) metrics correctly
- **Power/Weight Comparisons**: Removed double-negation logic that caused efficiency and weight comparisons to be backwards

#### Technical Details
- Simplified comparison logic to consistently evaluate computer1 vs computer2
- Removed confusing "better computer" selection that mixed up which system was being described
- Fixed unit consistency in all comparison evaluations

## [2.0.0] - 2024-06-04

### üéâ Major Redesign - Clean, Smart Visualizations

#### Added

  - Small differences (2-20√ó): Simple side-by-side bars
  - Medium differences (20-1000√ó): Proportional circle comparisons  
  - Huge differences (1000√ó+): Scale acknowledgment with clear messaging
- **Comprehensive Computer Database**: 60+ computers from 1946-2024
  - Early computers (ENIAC, UNIVAC)
  - Complete Intel evolution (8086 ‚Üí Core i9)
  - AMD processors (Athlon ‚Üí Ryzen 9)
  - Apple Silicon (M1 ‚Üí M4)
  - ARM/Mobile (Snapdragon series)
  - Space computers (Apollo, Voyager, Shuttle)
  - Gaming consoles (NES ‚Üí PlayStation 5)
  - Supercomputers (Cray-1 ‚Üí Frontier)
  - **Fictional computers**: HAL 9000, Skynet, Enterprise, Jurassic Park SGI, WOPR, Mother
- **Intelligent Unit Conversion**: 
  - Memory/Storage: KB ‚Üí MB ‚Üí GB ‚Üí TB with original values in brackets
  - Automatic unit selection based on magnitude
- **Contextual Language**: Proper comparative descriptions
  - "Lighter/heavier" for weight
  - "More/less power efficient" for power consumption
  - "More powerful/less powerful" for computation
- **Compact Information Layout**:
  - Summary grid showing key ratios upfront
  - Computational breakdown with clear formulas
  - Clean spec cards with organized information

#### Changed
- **Complete Interface Redesign**: Cleaner, more readable layout
- **Visualization Logic**: Charts now scale appropriately to difference magnitude
- **Performance Summary**: Uses appropriate comparative language instead of generic "faster"
- **Spec Display**: Better organized with proper unit formatting

### Removed
- Cluttered multi-visual displays that were hard to interpret
- Confusing pixel visualizations for small differences
- Generic "faster" language for all comparisons

## [1.5.0] - 2024-06-03

### üß† Accurate Computational Metrics

#### Added
- **True Computational Power Calculation**: Cores √ó MHz √ó IPC = MIPS

#### Changed
- **Replaced Raw MHz with MIPS**: More accurate performance representation
- **Enhanced Computer Specifications**: Added cores, IPC, and bit width for all systems
- **Improved Comparisons**: Now account for architectural differences beyond clock speed

#### Fixed
